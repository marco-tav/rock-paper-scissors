# Tic-Tac-Toe redo

Just a re-do of the tic tac toe project to quickly refresh concepts.

## Issues

- The function that takes the user input needs better error management. It should ask for the user's input again if it's wrong.
- The scoring system works but I think something nicer should be used when doing the version with an interface.
