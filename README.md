# Tic-Tac-Toe redo

Just a re-do of the tic tac toe project to quickly refresh concepts.

## Issues

So far everything works but there are things I'd like to do to make it 
work in a more realistic way: 
 - I want, after every match (i.e. when the either the player's or the computer's score reaches five) for the event listeners on the r-p-s buttons to be removed and let the play again button be the only way to start another match.
